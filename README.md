## Public Projects 

The following projects are currently available publicly on my GitHub profil: 

### Veterinarian Website
This web application was created for a veterinarian clinic in Remshalden, Germany. For the creation Wordpress in combination with Elementor was used.<br>
This website was entirely designed and developed by me. 

### Bachelor Project / Touch-less Ticket Vending Machine
This project contains the prototype of a contact-less ticket vending machine. The curser moves via gesture controll, so it is necessary to have a Leap Motion controller, to capture the motions of the user. 

### Dynamic Network
In this project, all data from my software project at the University of Konstanz is stored. However, to execute it the University access is neccessary, since it is not publicly available yet. 

### Space Shooter
This folder contains a space shooter application for Android. I developed this application in my free time to get familiar with Unity and the programming language C#. Since I stopped programming this app after this familiarisation phase, it is already playable, but does not reflect my current skills.
