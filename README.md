Hey, my name is Simon Lenhart and I am a 23-year-old computer science student at the University of Konstanz. Currently I am writing my bachelor thesis about touch-less interaction with a ticket vending machine.

## Public Projects 

The following projects are currently available publicly on my GitHub profil: 

**Bachelor Project / Touch-less Ticket Vending Machine** 
This project contains the prototype of a contact-less ticket vending machine. The curser moves via gesture controll, so it is necessary to have a Leap Motion controller, to capture the motions of the user. 

**Space Shooter** 
This folder contains a space shooter application for Android. I developed this application in my free time and it is already playabel, but new features are constantly added.

**Dynamic Network** 
In this project, all data from my software project at the University of Konstanz is stored. However, to execute it the University access is neccessary, since it is not publicly available yet.
